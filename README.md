# 📈 Stock Price Forecasting Project

Welcome to my **Stock Forecasting Project**, where I’ve explored both frontend and backend techniques to forecast stock prices over time.

This project is divided into **two parts**:

1. 🌐 **Frontend-Only Forecast**: A basic interactive interface built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to visualize static and dynamic stock data.
2. 🐍 **Full-Stack Forecast with Python**: A robust backend system leveraging powerful forecasting models like **ARIMA**, **Prophet**, **EMA**, **Linear Regression**, and **LSTM** using Python libraries (pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, keras, and more).

## 💻 Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)

The frontend section of this project showcases:

- Basic stock chart visualizations
- Interactive dropdowns and data displays
- Responsive design
- A clean, minimalist UI for presenting forecasts

This section was built to demonstrate my proficiency in **basic frontend development** and design thinking.

## 🧠 Backend Forecasting Models (Python)

To deeply understand stock trends and build accurate forecasts, I’ve used the following models:

### 1. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- A traditional time series forecasting model
- Best for linear trends and stationary data
- Captures autocorrelation, trend, and seasonality

📦 Libraries: `statsmodels`, `pandas`

### 2. Prophet (by Facebook)
- Excellent for business time series with strong seasonal effects
- Handles holidays, outliers, and missing data gracefully
- Easy-to-use and interpretable parameters

📦 Libraries: `prophet`, `matplotlib`

### 3. EMA (Exponential Moving Average)
- A smoothing technique that assigns more weight to recent prices
- Great for short-term trend following
- Used to detect momentum and signal changes

📦 Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`

### 4. Linear Regression
- A simple yet powerful regression model
- Models relationship between time and price
- Best for linear trend patterns

📦 Libraries: `sklearn`, `pandas`, `seaborn`

### 5. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)
- A deep learning model designed for sequence data
- Captures long-term dependencies and complex patterns
- Best suited for highly non-linear and noisy stock data

📦 Libraries: `tensorflow`, `keras`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
